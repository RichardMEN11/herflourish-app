Outdated Stigmas and The Gender Wage Gap According to studies, women are more likely to repay loans than men. They’re also better investors and less likely to get turned down for unsecured personal lines of credit. Meanwhile, women are at an 80% greater risk of becoming impoverished by retirement. So, what’s the deal? Much of the problem could stem from a lack of good information and practical financial advice. For example, a study of over 300 published articles revealed some startling facts. More than 65% of the literature taught women fiscal responsibility through coupon-clipping and limited spending. But articles aimed at men discussed investments, power moves, and acquisitions. Skeptics might assume that our society focuses more on educating men about finances than women. Female audiences typically receive discount codes, bargain pricing, and sales jargon. At the same time, the average woman still makes less than the average man – 82 cents on the dollar, to be exact. Poor financial literacy plus a lower-paying job equals strife in many cases. Yet, having financial independence means liberty and justice for all. So, learn personal finance for women and set the pace for your future – no holds barred.

Personal Finance Terminology Financials can be challenging to understand because of the complex terminology. That means people often become overwhelmed or confused before getting started. And while you don’t need an economics degree to build generational wealth, some basic knowledge is crucial. Review these terms first:

Budget A budget is an organized list or schedule that determines how you plan to allocate your cash. It outlines where, when, and how your money flows in and out of the bank. Thus, it helps you track spending, make investments, and create savings in real-time.

Debt Debt is how much you owe to various creditors. It consists of borrowed funds that you’re still repaying. So, include medical bills, student loans, mortgages, vehicle notes, and credit cards to calculate your obligations. Then work to pay down debts and keep more money in your pocket.

Interest Interest is the extra money you pay on loans. It acts as a security to the lender, and the amount usually depends on accrual. However, banks can also apply interest to your accounts. And over time, your savings could grow.

APY APY stands are “Annual Percentage Yield.” It represents the interest rate that your bank account accumulates throughout the year. Each financial institution is different. But you can earn a significant profit if you keep your cash at the right spot.

401k A 401k is a retirement and savings plan offered by an employer. Contributions to your 401k are automatically withheld from your paycheck for you and dispersed into funds of the employee’s choosing.

Roth IRA Roth IRAs are a type of retirement account. You deposit funds based on a percentage of your income. And you can use IRAs to build financial independence while enjoying tax-free economic growth.

Annuity Annuities are insurance products that provide consumers with guaranteed income for life. However, you may need a financial advisor to help you establish and maintain one. A basic understanding of standard financial terms gives you the power to make smarter decisions. So, don’t stop there. Dig deeper to develop an intuitive approach to personal finance for women.

Beginner’s Guide to Personal Finance for Women Economic experts all say the same things about building financial independence. They suggest getting out of debt, establishing an emergency fund, and learning how to budget money. But economists don’t regurgitate lousy information for the sake of popularity. They give the standard advice because it actually works. And here is why:

#1. Emergency Funds Get You Out of Trouble Don’t start making significant money moves until you have a backup plan. A leading wealth expert, Dave Ramsey, suggests having no less than $5,000 in emergency cash. Plus, he says women should create savings as quickly as possible. That’s because females typically live longer than men and manage more health problems than the average Joe. You don’t have to scramble to get everything together. Just look at your previous bank statements to determine where you could cut spending. For example, how many unnecessary subscriptions do you pay each month? That money might be better sitting in a high-yield savings account instead. So, examine your finances. Then shave the areas that don’t necessarily contribute to your financial health. NOTE: Emergency funds are crucial because they prevent us from making difficult decisions.

#2. Debts Can Devour Your Extra Cash Looking at a mountain of debt can be overwhelming and disheartening. And the thought of paying it off might feel like a million miles away. But you can tackle old debts using the snowball method. Here’s how it works:

Calculate your monthly income and subtract the expenses. Determine what’s leftover after you pay all the bills. Snowball the surplus into your outstanding debts to pay them off quicker. Start with the most negligible obligations to remove them from your budget and credit report. Avoid borrowing more money until your debt-to-income ratio is at least 30:70.

Another effective strategy is the debt avalanche method. And it goes a little something like this:

Create a budget and calculate your debt to income ratio. Begin paying the most significant debts with the highest interest rates first.

If you owe more than you make in a year, consider debt counseling. You can also think about filing bankruptcy for a fresh start or entering debt repayment programs for more time. Either way, try not to do anything until you consult a financial advisor.

#3. Learn How to Spend Your Money Wisely Budgeting money is an essential part of personal finance for women. So, gather your recurring debts and keep them organized. Then track how much you spend each month on necessities, luxuries, or otherwise. And if you can, create a comprehensive spreadsheet to monitor your fiscal behaviors over the year. There are several ways to budget your income. However, many women choose one of the two following methods:

The 50/30/20 Technique The Zero-Based Budget

Both budgeting styles help you prioritize your needs over wants. And they can each contribute to future financial freedom. However, the results can vary depending on your discipline. So, let’s look at each one more closely: The 50/30/20 Budget Method The 50/30/20 method of budgeting allows you to establish financial security without living like you’re broke. You use 50% of your income for basic living expenses such as housing, food, and utilities. The next 30% goes to pay for your wants. And the remaining 20% is for the savings account or investments. This technique only works if you understand the difference between wants and needs. For instance, you need safe housing. But you don’t necessarily need a six-bathroom estate in the sprawling countryside. You also need reliable transportation. However, you can get from point A to point B without driving an expensive sports car. The 50/30/20 method forces you to reevaluate your lifestyle. The Zero-Based Budget The Zero-Based Budget is more structured and disciplined than the 50/30/20 method. That’s because it forces you to use the first 50% of your income on everyday living costs. But the rest of your cash goes toward paying off large debts such as mortgages, student loans, and medical bills. The other 50% of your salary must also contribute to your retirement. So, there’s never much leftover for flagrant spending. NOTE: This approach works best for small business owners, entrepreneurs, and heavy investors.

#4. Make Your Money Do the Work Many women struggle to make ends meet and keep extra cash for a rainy day. And while having a savings account is great, having one that accrues interest is even better. Putting your funds into a stale institution means you do all the work. But high-yield accounts do some of the work for you. Eventually, you’ll see more significant numbers on the bank statements. Then you can use those surplus funds to invest in volatile stocks. Learning how to invest capital is one of the most critical lessons of personal finance for women. And fortunately, there are countless budgeting apps to help you track spending, move invested capital, and determine your next plays. Check a few of these out when you get the time:

In the meantime, brush up on your knowledge about brokerages. The reason is that a brokerage can handle complex investment portfolios on your behalf. Experts intuitively understand global stock exchanges and can do most market research behind the scenes. Brokers also analyze various industries to determine where your money will grow the most. Brokers don’t just work with stocks, either. They offer various services to support personal finance for women in the workplace. Discuss estate planning, retirement options, and modern money management skills to establish fiscal peace of mind. But remember that brokerage firms don’t work for free. So, you must allocate funds for professional services if you use them.

Remember the Rule of 72 The Rule of 72 is one of the best-kept secrets of personal finance for women. It estimates how long an investment will take to mature (or double) by assuming a fixed APR and minimal additional contributions. The R72 consideration is wise for new investors. Plus, you can use it to calculate the compound interest return on many accounts. For example, let’s say you invest $100,000 and want to know how long before it’s worth $200,000. Now let’s also assume your annual ROI is 7%. You’d divide 72 by 7 to determine the length of time it would take for your investment to double (10.29 years). For more information on how this works, consult a financial advisor.

How Personal Finance for Women Affects Your Credit Credit is generally defined as a contract agreement in which a borrower receives a sum of money or something of value and repays the lender later, generally with interest. It’s essential to have a good credit score. Your credit score is used to judge your reliability and financial risk. Yes, it’s important financially, but it also can affect things such as your ability to get a job, qualify for a loan, and can actually save you money. Like the emergency fund mentioned earlier, having decent credit is a safety net. When life inevitably happens, you’ll have the security you need if you have a high credit score. Factors that affect that score are payment history, the length of account history, and credit card activity. Make your payments on time to avoid taking any hits. After having established healthy credit, you will be able to simplify your life when purchasing a home or a new vehicle. If you don’t have any credit, take these steps to establish yourself.

Let’s say you have good credit and want excellent credit use take these actions:

Avoid applying for multiple lines of credit. Each application affects your credit health. Ask for higher credit limits (But don’t actually spend to your limit) Check your credit. Like your finances, your credit is in your control and needs to be reviewed.

If you have poor credit, you can work on your score solo or hire a firm to help you. However, credit repair companies cannot remove anything from your credit report. Plus, they’re not doing anything you cannot do yourself (i.e., paying your bill).

Conclusion Females are not fiscally illiterate, although many publications might suggest otherwise. With good information and intelligent money moves, personal finance for women becomes more natural. Modern ladies are making strides to become financially independent despite the hurdles. And you should be well on your way to doing the same after reading this guide.  

Are you ready to get paid what
you deserve?
Did you know increasing your salary is the easiest and fastest way
to make more money? It's true! Just a single raise can boost your
salary by thousands of dollars.
And that's just the frst year. A one-time salary increase of $5,000
— properly invested — adds up to over $1,300,000 by the time
you retire. Talk about a Big Win.
No more frugality. No more cutting coupons. No more worrying
about bills.
That single conversation can be worth enough money to spend
lavishly on things you love, take that exotic trip, pay off debt, buy
drinks for your friends, even retire early — and you don’t even
have to do any extra work.
Like I always say, there's a limit to how much you can save, but
there's no limit to how much you can earn.
And with just one conversation, you can boost your income for
life.
Who Am I?
Hi, I'm Ramit Sethi, New York Times
bestselling author of I Will Teach You
To Be Rich. I've helped millions of
readers build businesses, land their
Dream Jobs, become debt-free, and
master their inner psychology so they
can build a Rich Life.
How much is one raise worth to you?
We all love getting bonuses.
But imagine what it’d feel like to get a raise — not just one big
check — but a bigger paycheck every payday for life.
It transforms how you think about things like debt, savings, vacations, and shopping — because you have more money to live a
Rich Life and do the things you want.
Whether you want to travel to visit friends on the weekend, buy
something extravagant you love, pay off the mortgage, or just buy
drinks for your friends... I want to show you how much just one
relaxed conversation with your boss could be worth to you.
So I created this calculator to show you how much you can gain
from even just one raise.
So why is negotiating our
salaries so rare?
We all want a raise, but nobody really tells us how to get one.
What do you say to your boss? What can you do to make your
boss HAPPY to pay you more?
Yes, we hear woo-woo statements like, “Be yourself!” And we see
blog posts that tell us, “Wear your best outfit and smile.”
With advice like that, it's no wonder most raise conversations go
like this:
US: “It’s been a while since I got more money, and I think I deserve to get a raise. Is that something you can do?”
BOSS: "There’s no room in the budget for that. Maybe next year.”
US: "Oh, okay. Thank you."
It’s embarrassing and humiliating — especially because we know
other people still got big raises.
We tell ourselves things like:
“I can’t negotiate.”
“The economy is terrible. My company is struggling.”
“If I just work harder, my boss will notice me.”
And we settle for a fraction of what we deserve.
But you don’t have to be a master negotiator to boost your salary
— and your company doesn’t have to be raking in money.
The reason is an impolite little secret your boss doesn't want you
to know:
We all want a raise, but nobody really tells us how to get one.
$5,000 or $10,000 means nothing to a
company, but it means everything
to you
Here’s the key: even if your boss notices you, he won’t pay you
more unless you ask. (After all, would you pay $110 for something
with a $100 price tag?)
Until now, most of us never had the tools to avoid common
raise-killing mistakes.
Do you make these negotiation mistakes?
The frst step to boosting your salary is to STOP shooting yourself
in the foot. Most hopeful negotiators walk into these well-known
traps and never get out of them. This guide will walk you through
each of these, but first, beware the danger...
The jop 10 degotiation cistakes
1. Turning down offers and burning bridges
2. Never discovering what the interviewer is REALLY asking (the
question behind the question)
3. Asking weak questions (or no questions) when your boss or
interviewer asks, “Do you have any questions?”
4. Giving up or rambling when the boss says, “That’s out of our
budget” or “Maybe next year”
5. Not knowing what to say, or when to say, “No”
6. Never asking for a raise or negotiating your salary because “I
suck at interviews — I always fall apart or ramble”
7. Telling your previous salary — and instantly destroying your
chances of making a signifcant leap
8. Not planning in advance, even though 80% of the work happens before you ever enter the room
9. Ignoring psychology. Most people tell us to just ask for a raise...
but they don’t realize we have to get into our boss’s head AND
fgure out how to build our confdence and overcome nervousness
10. Fumbling through an interview — instead of knowing exactly
what words to say and how to say them

oour Dream Job... Wnd ^ow jo \ix jhem
Most of the questions I get about fnding a Dream Job are tactical
and focused minor steps that should come later in the Dream Job
process.
I'm talking about questions like, “How should I format my resume?” and “What should I say about my last job if I didn't like it?”
These are good questions when you're ready to create your resume or interview for a job, BUT most job seekers make so many
mistakes before that point that they never get interviews and it
doesn't matter how fawless their resume is.
I've spent the better part of a decade mastering how to land a
Dream Job. I tested the steps on myself and received job offers
from top companies like Google and Intuit. And I've tested the
steps on friends who've used my system to land their Dream Jobs
and score $10,000 raises at the same time.
The system works. I've mapped out the exact steps you should
take to fgure out what your Dream Job is, fnd unadvertised jobs,
make your network work for you, land job interviews, get job offers, and negotiate your benefts.
I've ALSO learned what steps you should AVOID at all costs. Mistakes so harmful I like to call them “Dream Job Killers.”
Unfortunately, these lessons aren't common knowledge. I was
reminded of that when I offered a full scholarship to my Dream
Job Elite program and couldn't pick one — not a single applicant
— because they all shot themselves in the foot with one or more of
these mistakes.
Over 1 million people read my blog every month, and out of that
pool, no one applying for the scholarship avoided the “Dream Job
Killers.” I tell you this to point out how prevalent these mistakes
are and how much of a leg up you'll have once you learn to identify and avoid them.
That's what this presentation is all about.

By now, you’ve probably heard that the 12-week paid family and medical leave program fell out of the social policy bill last week. That leaves the United States  with no national paid leave program.

Sadly, we all lose here. When it’s offered, the benefits of paid leave for families  for kids, families, and even businesses. (It’s not even hyperbole to say humankind at large.)

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the connections among three things that we know.

First thought: If you want to improve a society, you get more money into the hands of women.

When we say nothing bad happens when women have more money, it’s not some catchy slogan. It’s facts.  grow. And when women have more money, more of it goes back into their . Right now the opposite is happening. Which leads me to …

Second thought: The gender wealth gap is wide, and it’s been getting wider.

Some  during the pandemic, and many have not gone back as they struggle with access to child care and bear the brunt of COVID-19 school closures. As the sociologist Jessica Calarco put it: “Other countries have social safety nets. The US has women.”

The gender pay gap gets a lot of play, but the gender wealth gap is even more important. On average, US women own just  cents for every dollar a man owns, while Black and Latinx women own . (And those numbers were calculated before the pandemic.)

The cost of the pandemic to women may well be decades of economic and financial progress. Which means that the cost to their families is that same loss of economic and financial progress. So, again — we. all. lose. File this under: catch-22, or vicious circle, or endless loop.

Third thought: Our country is divided, angry, and scared.

Recently, when researchers surveyed people from 17 countries to ask about divisiveness, Americans were most likely to say  along partisan, racial, ethnic, and religious lines. The US was also one of just five countries in which more than half said their fellow citizens can’t agree on basic facts.

At the same time, it’s notable that  weathered the pandemic better; that women are ; that women are more interested in . (In fact,  invest in .)

So I can’t help but think that women having less money and power, and our country being so divided, seem undeniably intertwined.

Of course, these issues are complex and multi-dimensional. And that doesn’t mean that social media hasn’t been a driver, or that the pandemic hasn’t made things worse, or that our school systems don’t need to modernize.

But this is why Ellevest’s mission will always be to get more money — and thus power — in the hands of women. Let’s keep helping other women network and find jobs, supporting women-owned businesses, and remembering the politicians who are supporting — and not supporting — policies that help women.

Women are better educated and more successful than they have ever been. However, with income disparities between men and women and more frequent professional interruptions due to family responsibilities, many women feel powerless when it comes to personal finance. Take charge of your finances every day. This will not only empower you but will also ensure that you create a financial blueprint for your future.



Women's attitudes toward money have changed considerably over the previous few decades, but the association isn't as strong as it should be in today's environment. Women's confidence grows as they become more involved in their finances, and gain the ability to maintain control of their financial lives throughout time․ It is far too vital for women to be financially literate and capable of financial planning. 




The Importance of Having a Financial Plan
Women must concentrate on financial planning to achieve their long-term objectives and desires. Here's why investment planning is crucial for today's women.

It provides financial independence - Financial independence is synonymous with financial freedom. Every woman who aspires to be financially self-sufficient must develop the ability to meet her financial demands. She must begin by accumulating funds through a smart investment strategy.


It helps women meet their life goals - Women today have a variety of professional and personal goals. It might be anything from traveling the world to launching their own business. All of these objectives must be backed up by enough financial resources, which is where investment planning comes in handy. Without relying on others to support their objectives, women can achieve their goals in the timeframe required with the correct financial plan.


It's crucial for retirement - It's no secret that women live longer on average than men. Both homemakers and working women, on the other hand, frequently rely on their spouses for financial security in retirement. Women, on the other hand, will find it easier to financially secure their retirement years with the correct investing strategy.




Women have a stronger need than males to think critically and actively manage their finances. Unfortunately, they are less likely to regard investment as a top priority. Here are key factors why women can’t properly manage their finances:


Lesser earnings 

It is a well-known truth that, on average, women earn 20% less than males for the same work around the world. As a result, their lifetime earnings are lower than males in identical occupations. This depletes their retirement funds and savings. Women also take job pauses to care for their families.


Awareness 

Lack of financial knowledge also contributes to lower savings and higher needs. According to data on gender and financial literacy,  the gender gap is around 5% across the BRICS and 8% for the G7 countries.




Budgeting, saving money, regulating spending, handling debt, participating in financial markets, planning for retirement, and successfully amassing wealth are all skills that financially educated people excel at.


Career breaks

There's no doubt that women are more likely to take career pauses than men. This can happen at any point in a woman's life, including when she gets married, has children, or when her spouse is transferred to another place. Women have also been taking professional pauses in recent years to upskill or pursue higher education. A career break also involves a loss of income. Savings and investment income come in handy during these times.


Whether you're a woman or a man, young or old, single or married, the basic fact is that you must take charge of your finances. Financial independence entails having the knowledge and confidence to make your own financial decisions, not just how much money you have.


Women, in particular, must take charge of their finances and claim their authority. Financial independence is liberating. You're taking control of your life by taking control of your finances. 





5 Steps To Becoming A Financially Savvy Woman

1. Make Retirement a Top Priority

Women are notorious for prioritizing the needs of others, but when it comes to retirement, you must consider your requirements. Take control of your financial destiny by making the most of all available options. The goal is to save as much money as possible as fast as possible. That may appear to be a lot, but retirement can be a long time, especially for women. In retirement planning calculations, many financial advisors recommend assuming you'll live to be at least 90 years old. So, you must be well-prepared.


2. Work with a Financial Coach

Having a support team can enhance your confidence when it comes to investing and managing your money. Consider working with a coach, even if you're just getting started—and especially if your assets expand. Consider a financial coach to be similar to a personal trainer: someone to guide and motivate you when you're feeling overwhelmed or tempted to give up.




A coach can help you see the broad picture and create a budget that fits your objectives. Working with a coach who understands you can also provide a great deal of comfort.


After scheduling the first appointment with the specialist, you’ve got some homework to do. And if you want your meeting to be more effective and successful you need to prepare a list of your financial goals.

3. Work With a Budget

You'll need an impenetrable budget to regain control of your finances. This will provide you a general idea of how much money comes into your family, your financial obligations, and how much money is left after all of the bills are paid. This will enable you to begin setting aside a set amount each month for your savings goals, whether it's a rainy day fund, long-term savings for an overseas vacation, or even retirement. Set up automatic payments into a suitable investment to enable this so you don't have to think about it. The most critical step is to create a savings strategy. 


4. Open a Bank Account

Many women who have previously relied on someone else to manage their finances do not have their bank accounts. Women in this circumstance should be informed that if their partner dies suddenly, their bank account may be frozen, and they may be unable to access funds for a long period. That's why you should establish your bank account with enough emergency cash to cover six months' worth of living expenses.



5. Plan for Life Changes

When life throws you a curveball, such as losing a spouse or facing the prospect of divorce, having a plan to fall back on maybe calming and provide clarity at a time of uncertainty and loss. Similarly, it is critical to begin planning for happy events as soon as feasible. If you're getting married, for example, establishing a detailed financial plan will help clear up any potential confusion regarding the goals you want to attain, both individually and jointly, your attitudes toward money, and the assets you each brought into the relationship.


It's not simply about how much money you have when it comes to financial independence. It's also about having the ability to make independent decisions. Whether you're a woman or a man, single or married, you need to be in charge of your finances. Women, in particular, must take more initiative. By doing so, we can all contribute to the effort to create a world that is gender equitable for ourselves and future generations.

What Does Financial Independence Mean? 

Financial independence is when you have enough money saved and invested to support your basic living expenses for the rest of your life – without having to work for a living. Achieving financial independence is when you’re able to do whatever you want without worrying about money.

As you can see, achieving financial independence could be synonymous with freedom.

You have the choice to do whatever you want to do – without worrying about how money could impact your plans.

Financial independence could be split into 3 main categories:

FIRE
Fat FIRE
Lean FIRE
FIRE Defined:
Financial Independence Retire Early
Here is a brief example of what each FIRE movement means:

FIRE Movement	Definition
FIRE

You’re not spending money on things that don’t matter both during pre-retirement and post-retirement.

You’ll typically want to save between $1 million and $2 million in assets.

Fat FIRE

Living on a large budget both pre-retirement and post-retirement.

You’ll typically want to save around $2 million+ in assets.

Lean FIRE

Living on a small budget both pre-retirement and post-retirement.

You’ll typically want to save a maximum of $1 million or less in assets.

Now, take a look at the chart below:

Net Wealth Target to Hit Financial Independence
As you can see, the amount of money you need to save to be financially independent totally depends on your lifestyle choices.

However, most people who have joined the FIRE movement would prefer to retire later in life and live more comfortably than retiring earlier and living on less.

Fat FIRE vs Lean FIRE
Most people aiming to join the FIRE movement, are looking to retire early with assets between $500,000 to $2MM in net worth.

The average Financial Independence number is between 500000 to 2 million in net worth
Ultimately, the younger you are when you start investing, the more likely you’ll achieve financial independence early on.

How to Become Financially Independent

Now that you know the definition of financial independence, let’s take a look at the steps you need to take that to become financially independent.

Ignore the Joneses
1. Ignore the Joneses

Keeping up with the Joneses is a losing battle. 

The proverbial “Joneses” is the family that:

Drives the latest cars
Lives in the biggest home
Takes the nicest vacations
Buys the hottest tech gadgets
Stop competing and stop trying to buy the most expensive items. 

Achieving financial independence has to do with spending less than you earn.

Pro Tip:
Building wealth really isn’t rocket science. As long as you spend less than you earn and invest the difference, you should see results fairly soon.
One of the fastest ways to fight the “Jones Syndrome” is to create a budget.

A budget is a millionaire planning tool.

Budgets help make your dream life a reality.

Tweet
Budgets are awesome planning tools because:

They help you accomplish your goals
They shed light on your spending habits
They improve your money management
They help you gain control of your money
One of the highest-rated budgeting tools is known as YNAB (aka You Need A Budget) 👇

YNAB
On average, new budgeters save $600 in their first two months and more than $6,000 in their first year.

YNAB is software that’s 100% dedicated to your budget and was actually developed by a CPA (a Certified Public Accountant) for his new family to stay on track with spending. 

The YNAB app has become so successful, that it’s helped new YNABers save on average:

$600 in their first 2 months
$6,000 in their first year
Take a look at my comprehensive YNAB Review to learn more about the budgeting app.

When you stop competing with the Joneses, you’ll be the winner.

Increase Your Savings Rate
2. Increase Your Savings Rate

An important lesson that I’ve learned is that income does not equal wealth.

Income does not equal wealth.

Tweet
In fact, I’ve met a couple (a lawyer and his wife) who earn $900,000 per year, are in their late 60’s, and they will have to work for the rest of their lives because they have saved only $100,000 over their lifetime.

On the other hand, I’ve seen assistants earning $50,000 a year who managed to save and invest over $200,000 in just a few years.

To become financially independent, you need to increase your savings rate.

Pro Tip:
To live an above-average life, you’ll have to do what the average person won’t.
In this case, the average rule of thumb is to save between 10% to 20% of income.

If you want to achieve financial independence, you should aim to save at minimum 50% or more of your income.

In fact, if your savings rate is 50%+, studies suggest that you’re more likely than other groups to become financially independent.

If your savings rate is 50 youre more likely than other groups to achieve financial independence
I’m saving (and investing) just over 70% of my income – and I still feel like I can be doing a better job by increasing my savings rate to 80%.

Note:
Make sure you keep a portion of your saved money in an emergency savings account, while you invest the rest.
You’ll want to keep about 3 to 6 months’ worth of living expenses in cash in an emergency savings fund like Axos Bank 👇

Axos Bank
Grow your savings faster with interest compounded daily. No monthly maintenance fees. No minimum balance requirements.
Learn more
Axos Bank offers a high-yield savings account, with no monthly maintenance fees and interest rates that are more than 6X higher than the national average.

Increase Your Monthly Income
3. Increase Your Monthly Income

You can save as much as you want, but at some point, you just won’t be able to save more money because you still need to pay for basic living expenses. 

How much you can save is limited. How much you can earn is unlimited.

Tweet
In this case, you’ll want to make more money.

Of course, you could always ask for a pay raise on your job… or you could also consider starting a side hustle.

Side hustles, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, have peaked in popularity. 

In fact, just over 1 in 3 Americans have a side hustle.

Not surprisingly, 31% of side hustlers started their extra gig in 2020.

What’s even better is that 61.1 million Americans plan to start a side hustle in 2021.

31 percent of all side hustlers started in 2020
A recent survey shares that the average side hustle brings in about $1,122 per month.

Of the survey respondents making over $100 every month:

Side Hustle Statistics 2021
As you can see from the statistics above, achieving financial independence can be made a reality if you consider starting a side hustle.

Below I’ve compiled a list of side hustles for you:

Side Hustle	Potential Monthly Income
Blogging

$1,000+

Twitter Affiliate Marketer

$1,000+

Selling eBooks

$500+

Food Delivery

$600+

Online Surveys

$50+

Note that while there are some very lucrative side hustle businesses (like blogging or affiliate marketing), you’re probably not going to start earning $1,000+ in month 1.

These side hustles ideas take time to build up before they have the potential to make money while you sleep.

And that’s totally ok.

Make sure you pursue a side hustle because you enjoy it – and not just because of the money.

Live a Lean Life
4. Live a Lean Life

Becoming financially independent means you’ll probably have to sacrifice some of your daily luxuries.

If you’re looking to join the FIRE movement, you should start practicing frugal living habits and consider cutting out expenditures like: 

Eating out
Buying the latest gadgets
Traveling to hot vacation spots
Spending money on high-interest debt
FIRE early retirement is not all roses and butterflies. 

In fact, you’ll have to trim the fat and likely live a lean lifestyle.

Pro Tip:
One effective way to reduce daily living expenses is by analyzing your subscription expenses and whether you actually use these subscriptions.
Although most subscriptions typically don’t cost $100’s, the small, recurring charges can make a significant impact on your wallet at the end of the year.

In fact, forgotten subscriptions could cost you over $1,100 per year.

Below are some additional steps you can take to achieve financial independence:

Stick to a budget
Build a side hustle
Avoid high-interest debt
Max out retirement plans
Invest in the stock market
Remember that the earlier you start pursuing your FIRE goals, the better off you’ll be in the future.

Pay off Debt ASAP
5. Pay off Debt ASAP

If you have high-interest debt, then you’ll want to get rid of that debt ASAP. 

The billionaire Mark Cuban said it best:

"If you use a credit card, you don't want to be rich."

Tweet
I agree with Mark. 

If you use a credit card, then you’re essentially robbing your future self. 

Although it’s ideal to pay off your credit card balance every month, there are times when you need to take on credit card debt, and paying that off is much easier said than done. 

In cases like these, you do have options:

Consider debt consolidation
Consider a 0-balance transfer
Pay off the credit card with the lowest balance first*
Pay off the credit card with the highest interest rate first*
*While continuing making minimum payments toward your other credit cards, if you have any.

Debt consolidation may be an option for you if you’re struggling to make payments toward your credit card but are disciplined enough to not take on more credit card debt in the future.

Debt Consolidation Defined:
Debt consolidation is when you have a company pay off all of your debts (typically high-interest debts). You’ll no longer owe money to your original debtors, and instead, you’ll owe money to the debt consolidation company – which paid off your loans.
The good news is that debt consolidation companies often give you lower interest rates, more favorable terms, and a better loan pay-off schedule than your original debtors.

One of the most popular debt consolidation platforms is called Upgrade 👇

Upgrade
If you are feeling overwhelmed by the burden of your debt and unable to make on-time and consistent payments, you might want to consider consolidating your debt with Upgrade.
Learn more
Upgrade gives you a fixed rate and term with a clear pay-off date.

This can translate into savings while eliminating the surprises of high-interest rates that can change at any time.

The faster you pay off your high-interest debt, the faster you’ll reach financial independence.

Use the Right Tools
6. Use the Right Tools

If you walk into a professional hairdresser’s shop, you would expect them to use professional tools to cut your hair, right?

You wouldn’t expect a hairdresser to use plastic scissors to cut your hair. 

The same goes for achieving financial independence. 

The right financial tools can make or break your financial future, and that’s why I compiled a list of some of the best finance tools for you, below:

Finance Tool	Situation
Acorns

You’re just starting your investment journey and you don’t have a lot of money to invest – yet

M1 Finance

You’re somewhat comfortable with investing and can afford to invest $100’s or even $1,000’s

Seeking Alpha

You want to receive the best investment advice from investment industry experts

You can’t expect to become financially independent if you’re using the wrong tools.

Diversify Your Portfolio
7. Diversify Your Portfolio

If you already have:

An emergency savings fund
Paid off your high-interest debt
Set up your investment account
Invested in your employer-sponsored accounts
…Then you may want to consider investing in alternative investments.

Why?

Alternative investments could give you:

Higher returns
Exposure to other industries
Potentially achieve financial independence earlier
Just keep in mind that although alternative investments offer high returns, they are also riskier than your traditional investments.

Pro Tip:
When you put your money into alternative investments, make sure you would be OK losing the amount that you’re investing.
Alternative investments are risky, often volatile, and some may have you lock up your money for a long time.

The returns you receive from alternative investments could be worth the risk.

Below are some examples of proven and popular alternative investments:

Alternative Investment	What it Does
Fundrise

Invest in real estate for as little as $10

AcreTrader

Invest in farmland

Groundfloor

Play the role of the bank by funding short-term loans

Masterworks

Invest in multimillion-dollar paintings

Kraken

Invest in over 30+ cryptocurrencies

It’s true that you can make a lot more money by investing in alternative assets over investing in the stock market.

Just remember that a high return also usually means there is a lot of risk involved.

If you’re OK taking more risk, then alternative investments may be the right next step for you.

Why is Financial Independence Important?

The goal of financial independence is to be in control of your finances and not live paycheck to paycheck.

You live life on your own terms, you don’t worry about money, and you escaped the proverbial 9 to 5 rat race.

Financial independence is when you have enough money to afford basic living expenses for the rest of your life.

Pro Tip:
Job security is an illusion.
The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Recession of 2008 should have been blinding examples as to why you shouldn’t put all your income eggs in 1 basket (aka your job). 

Companies will ruthlessly be watching their bottom line – and if that means they need to let you go to save money, then there’s a high chance you’ll be gone before you know it. 

That’s why you owe it to yourself to build passive income streams today to secure your future income.

1. Investing more than what you can afford to lose
Investing is inherently risky. After all, nobody can predict with 100% certainty whether a company will succeed or fail. As such, there’s always a chance that you may end up losing the amount of money that you put into the stock market, cryptocurrency, precious metal, etc.

Therefore, I recommend that you focus on setting up your emergency fund and setting aside any money required for your immediate goals first before investing your money (you may want to use these frugal living tips!). Although you may have some opportunity costs since you are not investing as early as possible, you can sleep at night knowing that your more pressing needs are taken care of.

2. Not understanding your risk tolerance level
The general principle is that the higher the risk, the higher the return. However, when you envy that one person who manages to make a lot of money through investing, you must not forget that there are probably more people out there who are losing through the same thing.

Things are great when markets are going up. However, what would you do when the markets start going down? Will you actually be comfortable seeing your investment portfolio dropping 35% over a short week, or will you be frantically checking your portfolio every waking minute?

Close your eyes and picture these scenarios in your mind. Your true self will tell you how much risk you can tolerate. Do not invest in anything riskier than what you can truly tolerate, even if the expected return is higher.

3. Expecting that your actual return will equal the expected return
Expected return measures the amount of profit or loss an investor can expect to receive on an investment.

For example, if your investment portfolio has 40% chance of receiving an 8% return and a 60% chance of having a 3% return, then your expected return is 40% x 8% + 60% x 3% = 5%.

However, just because you expect to receive a 5% return does not mean that you will actually receive 5%. There are a lot of factors at play, including your time horizon, unexpected events (I mean, look at COVID!), risk level measured by standard deviation, when you enter the market, the likelihood of the positive return happening (e.g., think about 0.0001% of winning $10 million; the expected return is still positive), etc. Therefore, making investment decisions purely based on expected return calculations can be quite dangerous.

Of course, the expected return is an important measure to look at when you are evaluating an investment decision, but it shouldn’t be the only thing you look at. You should always review the risk characteristics of the opportunity to see if it aligns with your risk tolerance level.

4. Blindly following the advice of unqualified individuals
Just because someone else makes (or claims to make) a lot of money from a certain investment opportunity doesn’t mean that you will also profit from the same thing. He/she could have just gotten really lucky, whereas you may just be entering the market at the peak!

Whenever you hear about an opportunity to invest, do your own research! Understand why a certain company is doing well, why an opportunity may be suitable for you, and even simply whether the opportunity is legit or not.

5. Mixing emotions with investing
Investing can be truly emotional. It is exhilarating to see the stock market go up, but it also hurts to see the share price of a company that you dearly love loses half of its value within a few weeks.

Sometimes, you just have to admit to yourself that the boat has sunk, and it is time to say goodbye. Knowing when to cut ties with a losing position can save you a heartbreak – it still hurts, but if you continue, you may hurt more.

6. Impatience
Impatience goes hand in hand with “mixing emotions with investing”. It may prompt you to trade more frequently than necessary and thereby incurring more transaction fees, or it may cause you to exit or enter the market when it isn’t the best time.


Patience and discipline are key to a successful investing strategy. Market cycles are inevitable and you will see ups and downs, so you should be prepared for them well before they arrive. Plan ahead of time how you will react to significant market changes, and stick to your plan when they happen.


7. Buying back stocks too quickly after selling
When you buy back a property (can be stocks, cryptocurrency, etc) almost immediately (usually defined as within 30 days) after selling it at a loss, you will trigger something called “superficial loss”. A superficial loss is denied and added to the cost base of the property.

Here is an example of a superficial loss:

Dec 1, 2019: you purchased 100 ABC shares at $5 per share
Dec 18, 2020: you sold 100 ABC shares at $4 per share, incurring a brokerage fee of $20
Jan 2, 2021: you purchased 100 ABC shares at $4.50 per share
This means that for your 2020 tax return, you cannot claim a capital loss of (4×100-20) – 100 x 5 = $120, because this is a superficial loss. However, you can add the $120 to the cost base of your ABC share. As a result, on Jan 2, 2021, your cost base for ABC share is 100 x 4.50 + 120 = $570.

8. Not understanding the tax consequences of transactions
At the end of the day, what we care the most about is maximizing our after-tax money. Not knowing what tax consequence you will face when you buy/sell an investment product could lead to wrong investing decisions.

ill you fall short because you’ll lack the income in retirement to maintain your current lifestyle?

Consider the sources of income you will have and the necessary expenses you'll face to enjoy a comfortable retirement.

It may very well be the case that you’re already living close to the bone. But if not, right now, you need to decide what compromises you can make.

While some costs will fall away in retirement, others will surely rise.

Even with Medicare available at the age of 65, the average retiree could face out of pocket medical expenses of $5000 to $6000 per year, not including the cost of long term care.



At this stage, it’s overly simplistic to say that your income needs in retirement will be 80% or so of your current annual income, as is a commonly touted rule of thumb.

You’re close enough to retirement that you must now forecast what your spending needs will be with a higher degree of accuracy. (And do not forget to account for inflation.)

See: What Is Your Retirement Number?

Where You Live
Housing is likely your most significant expense.

Considering housing costs alongside taxes and the price of medical care, some people will contemplate a dramatic move to a place with a lower cost of living, perhaps even overseas.

But if finances are your sole reason for relocating away from your friends, family, and community connections, I would urge you to reevaluate that idea.

Retirement lasts a long time; you want to be surrounded by the people you love and who can support you. So if a move will allow you to both save money and be closer to a trusted support network, that’s a win-win.



If you'll pay off your mortgage before you stop working (and it’s a home you can safely and affordably remain in as you age), then you’re ahead of the game.

For the rest of us?

Calculate your mortgage or rent payment as a percentage of your expected Social Security payment; if the percentage is more than about one-third, every day in retirement may be a struggle without cash flowing in from another income source.

Can you use these years between now and retirement to downsize?

Can you acclimate to a home with a smaller footprint and/or in a different but still acceptable neighborhood?

See: Should I Move to a Lower Cost of Living Area?

Is there a possibility of refinancing your mortgage at a lower rate (and yes, extending the term of the mortgage) to reduce the monthly payment to a more comfortable level?

If it’s inevitable that you’re going to carry a mortgage into retirement anyway, it may as well be as cash flow friendly as possible.

What should take priority right now, retirement savings or debt repayment?
When you’re a single digit number of years away from retirement, concentrate on eliminating as much debt as possible (except your mortgage, unless it is close to pay off).



Doing so will allow your money for retirement to be solely focused on daily needs and wants. Not paying for yesterday’s decisions.

Debt
Your monthly retirement check, perhaps limited to Social Security, needs to be as unencumbered as possible. Please do not enter retirement with unsecured consumer debt.

If your highest non-housing debt payment is a student loan, now’s the time to calculate whether paying it off before or shortly after retirement is realistic or not.

I would very much love for you not to carry a student loan payment through retirement. But for many, it’s simply unavoidable; according to the AARP, 2.8 million people aged 60 or older have student loan debt.

If you have sizeable federal student loans that you cannot realistically repay before retirement, are you on an income-driven repayment program?

If so – heresy alert! – pay only the minimum amount. Any balance remaining will be forgiven after 20 or 25 years of payments, depending on the loan type. (The forgiven amount will be taxable.)



Emotionally, it may be helpful to “rethink” your student loan debt as “$X * Number of Payments Remaining” rather than the total balance owed.

Savings
Now I do want to talk about your retirement savings.

After putting your debt repayment plan in place and, of course, shoring up your current emergency savings, quite obviously, the next step is to increase your savings rate as much as possible.

Preferably you'll invest in a tax-advantaged retirement account (be that a workplace retirement contribution plan, an IRA, or both).

But let’s be clear: you cannot depend on the market to bail you out.

With retirement close by, you do not have enough years to put your savings at great risk in the hope that outsized stock market investment returns will deliver the portfolio balance you need.

Yes, you need to invest some in equities (retirement can last for decades).

But while you may have the emotional risk tolerance to bet it all, with only a few years between now and when you may need to draw on this account, you do not have the objective risk capacity to do so.

The most significant risk to the longevity of a retirement portfolio is when you must sell investments early in your retirement in a down market.



What else should you invest in?
Your health, for one. While nothing is guaranteed, the best way to reduce your spending on medical needs in retirement is to be as healthy as possible at the start.

Now’s the time to invest in preventative care, including vision and dental care, which Medicare does not cover. And yes, a healthy diet and exercise.

Every neighborhood has “that house”; the one close to falling down, lived in by an elderly person who can no longer afford its upkeep.

If you own your home and intend to keep it, use your remaining wage-earning years to get up to date on necessary (not merely cosmetic) maintenance.

You want your home as valuable and cost-efficient in retirement as possible and less of a drain on your limited cash flow.

The equity in your home is likely your largest asset in retirement; investing in your home now to maintain its market value will provide you with options in the future should you need to access a large sum of money.

And finally, Social Security.
Many Americans take Social Security when they are 62 years old. But unless you’re physically unable to work, that’s not going to be you.



You cannot afford the significant permanent reduction in monthly benefits that happens when you draw on Social Security before your full retirement age (67 for those born in 1960 or later).

Since Medicare is not available until you are 65 years old, how would you pay for healthcare if you left your job before then?

In fact, the question to ask is: “Can I continue working past my full retirement age?” For each year that you wait until the age of 70, your benefit increases by 8%.

If you have not done so already, download your Social Security Statement and see what your likely monthly benefit will be.

While you may consider taking on a part-time job for extra money to fill a monthly income gap in your later years, that may not be an option.

Strive to beef up your retirement nest egg now to reach your retirement goals.

Does your family understand your situation?
Are you providing financial support to an adult child that you cannot afford in reality?

Facing this is incredibly emotional and difficult. While there are certain instances when not providing support would be tragic for all concerned, you’re not doing your family any favors by neglecting your own needs now only to rely on them financially in the future.

If you have children entering their college years when you’re in your late 50s or early 60s, your retirement account balance must take precedence over their tuition.



It’s a cliché, but it bears repeating: they can borrow money for college, but you cannot borrow for retirement.

Final Thoughts
In summary, here’s the playbook:

Be prepared to change your definition of the “ideal” retirement.
Get granular in understanding your expenses in retirement and what source of income besides Social Security you can expect.
Eliminate as many monthly debt payments as possible before retirement. Minimize the size of the payments that will persist in retirement.
Besides investing in employer retirement benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs), make smart investments in your health and home to protect your cash flow in retirement.
Don’t swing for the fences with your investment account asset allocation. You can’t afford the risk to your retirement fund. Develop a sound investment strategy to strive for a reasonable rate of return.
Know your Social Security numbers. Keep working, delaying drawing retirement benefits as long as you can.
